      Generate a DSAT-style Reading question at ${difficulty} difficulty level.
      
      Choose ONE of these question types randomly:
      1. Specific Detail: Ask about locating and identifying specific information from the passage
      2. Main Idea: Ask about the central theme or main point of the passage
      3. Purpose: Ask about the author's primary purpose or intent
      4. Function: Ask about the function of a specific phrase or section
      5. Claims: Ask about evidence supporting or weakening claims in the passage
      6. Data Interpretation: Include a small data point and ask how it relates to the passage
      7. Complete The Text: Ask about logical completion of a thought or argument
      8. Cross Text: Provide two short related passages and ask about their relationship
      9. Structure: Ask about the organizational pattern or structure of the passage

      Follow these steps:
      1. Write a concise passage (80-120 words) appropriate for DSAT Reading.
         - For Cross Text questions, write two related short passages (50-60 words each)
         - For Data questions, include a simple data point or statistic
      2. Formulate ONE question based on the randomly chosen question type above.
         Use these example stems based on the question type:
         - Specific Detail: "According to the passage, what..."
         - Main Idea: "The main purpose of this passage is to..."
         - Purpose: "The author primarily intends to..."
         - Function: "The phrase [quote] primarily serves to..."
         - Claims: "Which choice provides the strongest evidence for..."
         - Complete Text: "Which choice most logically completes..."
         - Cross Text: "How do the two passages differ in their approach to..."
         - Structure: "The passage is primarily organized by..."
      3. Provide four answer choices labeled A, B, C, D.
      4. Indicate the correct answer.
      5. Provide a detailed explanation that:
         - Explains why the correct choice is correct
         - Briefly addresses why each other choice is incorrect
         - References specific parts of the passage(s)

         - Focus on typical DSAT Writing topics: grammar, punctuation, word choice, style, 
           sentence structure, or usage.
      2. Formulate ONE question that asks how best to revise the underlined or bracketed portion.
         - Example prompt: "Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions
